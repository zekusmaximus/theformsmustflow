  longBlurb: {
    v1: `The fleet descended from the stars with technology beyond human comprehension. Their mission: claim Earth for the Gloridian Empire. Their method: swift, efficient, inevitable.

What they didn't account for was Dave from Compliance.

In "The Forms Must Flow," Jeffrey A. Zyjeski delivers a satirical sci-fi novel that weaponizes the absurdity of modern bureaucracy against the tropes of alien invasion stories. When the Gloridian advance stalls in a maze of environmental impact assessments, historical preservation reviews, and interdepartmental coordination meetings, both species discover that the real battle isn't for territory—it's for who controls the narrative of delay.

Equal parts workplace comedy and high-concept speculative fiction, this is a story about institutional inertia, the quiet heroism of people who keep systems running, and the terrifying realization that sometimes the most powerful force in the universe isn't advanced technology—it's a properly filed Form 27-B/6.

For readers who love their science fiction smart, their satire sharp, and their aliens thoroughly confused by carbon copy requirements.`,
    
    v2: `They came with ships that could shatter continents. They left with a deeper understanding of why humans call it "red tape."

"The Forms Must Flow" is Jeffrey A. Zyjeski's debut satirical sci-fi novel, exploring what happens when an advanced alien invasion collides with the immovable object of human administrative procedure. The Gloridian Empire has conquered a thousand worlds through superior technology and ruthless efficiency. Earth presents a unique challenge: a species so committed to bureaucratic process that they've elevated delay to an art form.

As the invasion stalls in committee reviews and the aliens struggle to navigate permit applications, both sides must confront uncomfortable truths about power, progress, and the systems we build to manage them. Zyjeski weaves comedy and genuine tension into a narrative that asks: what if humanity's greatest defense isn't our weapons, but our inexhaustible capacity for procedural objection?

Cinematic in scope, sharp in wit, and unexpectedly resonant—this is invasion fiction for anyone who's ever waited six weeks for a signature.`,

  faq: [
    {
      question: "Is this actually science fiction, or just a comedy with aliens?",
      answer: "It's both. 'The Forms Must Flow' delivers genuine speculative fiction elements—alien technology, interstellar politics, cosmic stakes—while using bureaucratic comedy as its narrative engine. Think of it as sci-fi that happens to be funny, not comedy that happens to have aliens.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need to be a sci-fi expert to enjoy this?",
      answer: "Not at all. The story is designed to be accessible to any reader who enjoys smart, character-driven fiction. No prior knowledge of sci-fi tropes is required—though fans of the genre will appreciate how it plays with expectations.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is this making fun of government workers?",
      answer: "Quite the opposite. The novel celebrates the often-invisible work of people who keep complex systems functioning. The satire targets institutional absurdity, not the individuals navigating it. Many readers find themselves rooting for the bureaucrats.",

    {
      question: "Is this part of a series?",
      answer: "'The Forms Must Flow' is a complete, self-contained story. While the universe could support further exploration, this novel stands alone with a satisfying beginning, middle, and end.",
    },
    {
      question: "What's the tone—light or serious?",
      answer: "It balances both. The comedy comes from situation and character, but the stakes are real. You'll laugh, but you'll also feel genuine tension and investment in the outcome. It's humor that serves the story, not the other way around.",

  // 10. Teaser Sample Paragraphs (ACTUAL EXCERPTS FROM THE NOVEL)
  teaser: {
    v1: `THE INVASION LANDS

He walked among the crowd. Conversations flowed around him, mostly about paperwork. No one asked how to fight. They asked how to file.

He looked up at his hovering transports, sleek and lethal. One of them blinked hazard lights. A parking enforcement drone floated by, scanned the transport, and printed a ticket that fluttered down. VIOLATION: DOUBLE-PARKED IN LOADING ZONE. FINE: $75. The drone affixed another to his armor. He tore them both in half. The drone photographed the act and filed a report.`,
    
    v2: `THE CONFRONTATION

The door opened again, and High Commander Vex'thar entered. His armor was scuffed from the landing, a few dents from the chaotic touchdown.

"You are Mildred Higgins," he said. His voice carried the weight of command, translated through his implants into English with a slight metallic echo.

"Director Mildred Higgins," she corrected automatically. "Department of Consumer Experience Management. And you are?"

"Vex'thar. High Commander of the Mindrender Dominion."

She nodded, as if acknowledging a colleague at a interdepartmental meeting. "Pleased to meet you. Though I must note this detention lacks proper paperwork. No Form IC-1 filed, no witness signatures, no chain of custody documentation."

Vex'thar's tendrils flexed, a ripple of irritation passing through them. "We do not require your forms."

"Everyone requires forms," Higgins said calmly, her voice steady as she reached for an invisible stamp. "Even conquerors. It's how we maintain order. Without forms, there's only chaos.`,

    v3: `THE REVOLUTION

Outside, a Dominion dropship roared overhead. Its hull bore neon spray paint: LOCAL 47. The stencil dripped. It glowed. Another ship hovered behind, still pristine, still loyal. The two ships circled each other like predators unsure if they were also packmates.

Kr'thax stepped to the window. The city below looked like a diagram scribbled by multiple hands. Other barricades forming. Other queue ropes. Other ships landing to set up tables. Chanting wove together: "WHAT DO WE WANT?" "CLARITY." "WHEN DO WE WANT IT?" "AFTER APPROVAL."`,

    long: `Jeffrey A. Zyjeski writes satirical science fiction that finds the absurd in the familiar and the familiar in the absurd. His work explores the spaces where institutional logic meets human resilience, where cosmic stakes collide with everyday frustrations, and where the most powerful forces in the universe sometimes turn out to be the most mundane.

"The Forms Must Flow" is his first foray into sci-fi comedy, born from years of observing how complex systems function (and dysfunction) in modern organizations. The book celebrates the quiet heroism of people who keep things running while asking uncomfortable questions about the systems we've built—and whether they serve us as much as we serve them.

Zyjeski believes that the best science fiction doesn't just imagine new worlds; it holds a mirror to our own. He writes for readers who appreciate sharp wit, genuine stakes, and the occasional moment of recognition that makes them laugh out loud in public.

He lives with an appreciation for the people who keep complex systems running—and a healthy suspicion of any process requiring more than three signatures.`,
